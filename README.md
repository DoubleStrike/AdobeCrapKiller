# AdobeCrapKiller

A way to kill all the junk background processes that Adobe Creative Cloud fills your system with. Hit the Refresh button to load the list of Adobe processes, and then hit the "Kill that crap!" button to kill it. You can use the auto-refresh function to update the list every 3 seconds to make sure Adobe is not trying to use sneaky timer jobs or other techniques to start things in the background.

Adobe could have just let you close things properly, but no, they want to spy on your activity and waste resources doing it.  **It's your computer - don't let others waste your resources!**

## Future To-Do items
* Allow configurable timer for auto-refresh
* Allow user to enable/disable beep on auto-refresh (currently only beeps after manual refresh or kill)
